Howdy, thanks for taking the time to send in an issue! A quick note. We try to avoid
handling general troubleshooting issues here, but prefer to have folks ask those
on [StackOverflow])(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember.js) or on the
Slack `#needhelp` channel (https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

If you're having an issue with the super-rental tutorial though, please *do* ask here
so we can get the guides updated as needed ...

Fire away!
